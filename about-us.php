                            <h2 class="about__content--title mb-18">The Philosophy Behind Dr. Pal's Ayurveda Practice</h2>
                            <div class="about__content--step mb-25">
                                <p class="about__content--desc mb-20" style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Ombeer R. Pal’s Ayurveda practice is centered around the belief that true health is achieved when the body’s internal systems are in harmony with the natural world. Drawing from Ayurvedic philosophy, he emphasizes a personalized, holistic approach to healing that takes into account not only physical symptoms but also the emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of health.</p>
                                <p class="about__content--desc mb-20" style="text-align: justify;">At the core of Dr. Pal's approach is the concept of doshas, the three vital energies (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) that govern physiological and psychological functions in the body. Each individual is believed to have a unique combination of these doshas, and health issues arise when there is an imbalance in these energies. Through a detailed assessment of each patient’s dosha, lifestyle, diet, and mental state, Dr. Pal crafts customized treatment plans designed to restore balance and enhance vitality.</p>
                                <p class="about__content--desc mb-20" style="text-align: justify;">Another key component of Dr. Pal’s Ayurvedic practice is the emphasis on preventive health. Unlike conventional medicine, which often focuses on treating illness once it manifests, Ayurveda places great importance on maintaining health and preventing disease before it occurs. Dr. Pal advocates for dietary adjustments, herbal remedies, detoxification practices (such as Panchakarma), and daily routines that support optimal health and longevity.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h2 class="about__content--title mb-18">Integrating Modern Medicine with Ayurveda</h2>

                                <p class="about__content--desc mb-20" style="text-align: justify;">For example, for patients with chronic pain or autoimmune conditions, Dr. Pal may prescribe Ayurvedic herbal treatments and therapies such as abhyanga (oil massage), swedana (herbal steam therapy), or Shirodhara (a soothing oil treatment for the forehead) to reduce inflammation and promote healing. At the same time, he might integrate modern diagnostic methods such as blood work or imaging to monitor progress and adjust the treatment as needed.</p>
