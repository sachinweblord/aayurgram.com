Panchakarma means five procedures in Sanskrit. It is one of the most vital practices in Ayurveda which helps in clearing out all the toxins in the body. In Ayurveda it is considered to balance the doshas in our body known as "vata," "pitta," and "kapha." When the doshas are not in balance it means that there are a lot of toxins present in the body. Here Panchakarma plays the role of balancing the doshas by removing the toxins out of the body. Panchakarma not just purifies the body but also rejuvenates and builds up the immune system.
